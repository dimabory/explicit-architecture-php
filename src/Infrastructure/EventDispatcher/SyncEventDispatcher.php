/**
 * Conceptually, the code triggering an event must not rely on the logic that the event triggers. So that logic doesn't
 * need to, and should not, be executed in-line with the code triggering it.
 * This means that, technically, all events could be asynchronous, meaning that the logic they trigger could be
 * executed after the HTTP request has been handled and the HTTP response was sent back to the client. Ideally in
 * another process, started by a message bus/queue.
 * However, for UX reasons, sometimes we want to handle an event in the same request where it is triggered, so that we
 * make sure the user can see the expected results in the next request he makes.
 *
 * Thus, we have the need for two types of event dispatchers (which can be behind a proxy dispatcher):
 *      - A SyncEventDispatcher which dispatcher the events in the same request
 *      - An AsyncEventDispatcher, which sends the events to a message bus so they will be executed later, in parallel
 *
 * Nevertheless, despite the SyncEventDispatcher running the event listeners in the same HTTP request as the code that
 * triggered the events, it does not mean it must run those listeners in-line with the code that triggered the events.
 * Thus, this SyncEventDispatcher will put the events in a buffer, and it will flush them all to the listeners after
 * the system handles the HTTP request, and just before sending the HTTP response back to the client.
