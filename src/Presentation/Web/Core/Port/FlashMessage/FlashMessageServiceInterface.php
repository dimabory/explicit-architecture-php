/**
 * Although it looks like this port/adapter is something that should be in the `App\Core\Port` and `App\Infrastructure`
 * respectively, the fact is that this service is not used in the core, it is only used in the web UI. If we would
 * remove the web UI we would not need this interface at all.
 *
 * So following Uncle Bob packaging principles, we keep together the code that works together.
 *
 * This application only uses the success type of flash messages, but the CSS is already prepared to use these four,
 * so its nice to have them here to be easily used when needed as the application grows.
 * If at some point the application needs more, then and only then, we add here the new flash message name as a method,
 * as a constant, and the needed CSS to the CSS files.
 *
 * @see https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#alerts
