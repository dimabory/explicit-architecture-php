/**
 * This interface has no functional value, because it does not require a set of methods, but it does have semantic
 * value: It will explicitly tell us that an object implementing this interface is a notification
 * We will also know that any object not implementing this interface is not designed with the intention of being
 * dispatched by the notification dispatcher.
 *
 * Furthermore, it allows us to strong type the argument of the notification dispatcher, preventing us from making
 * the mistake of dispatching objects that are not notifications.
 *
 * We don't need to specify any other methods because there will be a specific generator for each specific notification,
 * so the generator will know the specific notification class and therefore will know what other methods are available.
