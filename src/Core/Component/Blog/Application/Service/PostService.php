     * This method is quite simple, so it might seem useless to have it. However, it is debatable if we should have it

     *  On one hand, this use case can be triggered from several locations and if/when we need to change it
     *      (ie to make it a soft delete instead of a hard delete or to send out an event), we would only need to
     *      change it here.
     *  On the other hand, being so simple, we could just use the repository directly in the controllers,
     *      and move the logic to a service only if/when the logic becomes more complex.
     *  Yet on another hand, if we use a command bus, any data changes must be done through a command/handler
     *      (so they can be queued and possibly retried) and such a simple operation is no exception.
     *
     * For the sake of the previous explanation, I decided to leave it here.
