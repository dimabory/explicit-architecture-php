# These lines define a route using YAML configuration. The controller used by
# the route (FrameworkBundle:Template:template) is a convenient shortcut when
# the template can be rendered without executing any logic in your own controller.
# See https://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/templating/render_without_controller.html

web_routes: # routes for the website, if we would have an API we would have a new node like this
    resource: 'routes/web/routes.yaml'
